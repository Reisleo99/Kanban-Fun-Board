# Kanban Board Application with JWT Authentication

## Description

This project is a full-stack Kanban board application where users can securely log in, manage their work tasks, and maintain authenticated access to their tasks using **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)**. The application provides a secure login page, JWT-based authentication, and allows users to interact with a Kanban board to manage tasks effectively.

## User Story

As a member of an agile team, I want a Kanban board with a secure login page so that I can securely access and manage my work tasks.

## Usage

### Login and JWT Authentication

1. Navigate to the login page.
2. Enter your valid username and password.
3. Upon successful authentication, a JWT will be generated and stored in local storage, allowing you to securely access the Kanban board.
4. If the username or password is incorrect, an error message will be displayed.
5. The token will be automatically removed from local storage upon logging out.

### Kanban Board

- Once logged in, you can manage your work tasks by creating, updating, and deleting Kanban board tickets.
- Tasks are categorized into columns such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

## Technologies

### Backend

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the server.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for task and user management.
- **jsonwebtoken (JWT)**: For secure token-based authentication.

### Frontend

- **React**: Library for building the user interface.
- **Axios**: To handle HTTP requests between the client and server.
- **Bootstrap**: For a clean, responsive UI design.

## Features

- Secure authentication using JWT.
- Login and logout functionality.
- JWT stored securely in local storage for subsequent authenticated requests.
- Full Kanban board functionality with tasks in different stages.
